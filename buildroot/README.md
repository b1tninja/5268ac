Ubuntu image used to build has a stdio.in.h that throws an unconditional warning on usage of gets() claiming its a security hole, so building the buildroot fails... need to build using an old gnulib

Was able to install ubuntu 12.04 from iso, and then manually install packages found on launchpad

https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/precise/

bison_2.5.dfsg-2.1_amd64.deb
flex_2.5.35-10ubuntu3_amd64.deb
libbison-dev_2.5.dfsg-2.1_amd64.deb
libfl-dev_2.5.35-10ubuntu3_amd64.deb
libncurses5_5.9-4_amd64.deb
libncurses5-dev_5.9-4_amd64.deb
libtinfo-dev_5.9-4_amd64.deb
perl_5.14.2-6ubuntu2_amd64.deb
texinfo_4.13a.dfsg.1-8ubuntu2_amd64.deb

Wasn't able to build autoconf / automake because microperl build was failing to include math functions from libm, saw this answer but still stuck:
